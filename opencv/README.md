# Learning OpenCV

## Getting started

### Set up
Install the *Anaconda* suite from *Continuum Analytics*.

Be sure to install for Python version **2.7**, **NOT** 3.x.

Download OpenCV 3.1 for Windows [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.1.0/opencv-3.1.0.exe/download).

Extract the folder **opencv** and go to **opencv**>**build**>**python**>**2.7**>**x64**
and place the file **cv2.pyd** into your
**C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda2\Lib\site-packages** folder.

## Structure
### Commercial
*commercial workshop elements*

**commercial** contains the polished up project versions created for commercial workshops
  **Examples** contains the polished, independent projects that attendees will create in the workshops
  **Instructions** contains code used in the workshop labs

### Demo
*presentation elements*

**demo** contains the demos I used in the presentation. The original python files
are stored in **demo/src**, and the batch files used in the powerpoint that contain
can be double-clicked to run the python code are in the **demo** folder itself

### Tutorials
An excellent set of Python OpenCV tutorials is available with the OpenCV documentation
[here](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0).


## **Happy OpenCV-ing!**
