# Learning OpenCV

## Getting started

### Set up
Install the *Anaconda* suite from *Continuum Analytics*.

Be sure to install for Python version **2.7**, **NOT** 3.x.

Download OpenCV 3.1 for Windows [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-win/3.1.0/opencv-3.1.0.exe/download).

Extract the folder **opencv** and go to **opencv**>**build**>**python**>**2.7**>**x64**
and place the file **cv2.pyd** into your
**C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Continuum\Anaconda2\Lib\site-packages** folder.

## Structure
### Commercial
*commercial workshop elements*
**commercial** contains the polished up project versions created for commercial workshops

### Demo
*presentation elements*
**demo** contains the demos I used in the presentation. The original python files
are stored in **demo/src**, and the batch files used in the powerpoint that contain
can be double-clicked to run the python code are in the **demo** folder itself

### Experiments
*projects I took on to better learn OpenCV*
- Comments may still need to be updated
- *experiments_pretty* is be the updated, commented, prettified version of experiments
- **experiments_raw** is where I post the code that I write before transferring it into pretty

### Tutorials
*tutorials I used to learn OpenCV*
These are excellent resources that I used to learn OpenCV, and contain commented code
from an outside tutorial featured in the OpenCV documentation. The original tutorials
are available [here](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0).

## Misc
*contains files I used for providing examples for the slides and other miscellaneous things*

## **Happy OpenCV-ing!**
