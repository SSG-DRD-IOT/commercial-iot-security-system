# OpenCV tutorials

**Disclaimer**:
The majority of the content is not mine, learned/written from the
[OpenCV-Python Tutorials](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d6/d00/tutorial_py_root.html#gsc.tab=0)


### Tutorial Flow
*GUI -> Core -> imageProcessing -> featureDetection -> videoAnalysis*
*Note*: I did not go into much depth in the featureDetection and videoAnalysis sections
due to time constraints, and focused the bulk of my work on the more fundamental
image processing examples and experiments utilizing these for real time video
